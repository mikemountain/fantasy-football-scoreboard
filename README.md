# fantasy-football-scoreboard
![I promise to change this picture when I actually build my own](imgs/Scoreboard.jpg)

Display your favourite fantasy football team score on an raspberry pi powered LED matrix. Currently supports 64x32 boards only, and the Sleeper fantasy platform.

### Credit and inpsiration
This project was inspired by the [nhl-led-scoreboard](https://github.com/riffnshred/nhl-led-scoreboard), who based THEIR project off of the [mlb-led-scoreboard](https://github.com/MLB-LED-Scoreboard/mlb-led-scoreboard). Go check them out, and start watching hockey if you don't already (and baseball too but I love hockey more (go Leafs!)).

## Features (v0.0.5)

### Updating!
Run `bash update.sh` after a pull to make sure you have the necessary packages because I actually don't know a better way to do this.

### Drafting
If you've set your draft time, you'll see something like this. ![time til draft](imgs/draft.jpg) 

Still working on getting something done for during the draft, that will be one of the next things to be worked on. 

Post draft, for now you'll just be shown a countdown 'til kickoff. Hoping to add more to it soon but we'll see what can be done. ![kickoff when](imgs/kickoff.jpg)

### Pregame
Currently shows your opponent's avatar, and their name (if it's 12 characters or less, otherwise it won't fit, see the picture at the top of the README). ![nameless and shameless](imgs/no_team_name_preview.jpg) Hoping to incorporate projections in future releases.

### Live scoring updates 
Starting at ~8pm Eastern Thursday, the score will be updated every 20s during game times (Thursday 8pm-12am, Sunday 1pm-12am, Monday 8pm-12am). ![live matchup](imgs/live_matchup.jpg) The colours will change red if a score goes down, and green if a score goes up. ![colour score](imgs/score_changes.jpg) There is also a "big play" notifier of when a team's score goes up by more than 5 points, because that's exciting. The team's score will go gold to show who got the big play. ![big play](imgs/big_play_capture.jpg)

Here's a gif that shows you what this would look like (excuse the shaky hands please, I was updating my testing REST API with one hand and filming with the other). ![score gif](imgs/big_play_and_updates.gif)

I plan to set this so that it only does these checks during actual game times, because there's no real point in checking for game updates on non-game days or during non-game times on gamedays. Eventually, I'd like to only check for score updates if there's a player in the matchup who's playing (v1.0.0 release).

### Postgame
The board will stay in a post-game state until the next week, and will easily disappoint you with a quick glance. Loser is red, winner is green, with LOSS or WIN in between for that extra oomph. ![post game recap](imgs/accurate_postgame.jpg)

### Off season
It displays a message that it's the off season. ![man it's offseason, take a break](imgs/off_season.jpg) You should just turn it off and plan to be heartbroken again next year.

## Roadmap

Future plans include:
* using different platforms (Yahoo first and then ESPN most likely (if at all possible))
* cycle through league scores on off-game times during the week (Post game could cycle through each matchup's result)
* finding a better way to set the opening day than a config option (but it's only set once a year so this is pretty low prio)
* different animations for good plays vs bad plays (nobody wants to see "BIG PLAY" and then see it's your opponent getting the points)
* cycle through multiple teams in multiple leagues so you don't just have to pick your favourite team (although we all have one best league)
* maybe some fun stuff for the draft like who just drafted whom and a countdown clock or something I don't know but it'll be flashy (can't do this yet with current sleeper api)
* analyze your team weaknesses and help with waiver pickups (will not do this)

## Installation
### Hardware Assembly
The [mlb-led-scoreboard guys made a great wiki page to cover the hardware part of the project](https://github.com/MLB-LED-Scoreboard/mlb-led-scoreboard/wiki). There's also this [very handy howchoo page](https://howchoo.com/g/otvjnwy4mji/diy-raspberry-pi-nhl-scoreboard-led-panel) which is what I mainly followed.

### Software Installation
#### Raspbian Distribution
It is recommended you install the Lite version of Raspbian from the [Raspbian Downloads Page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). This version lacks a GUI, allowing your Pi to dedicate more system resources to drawing the screen.

#### Requirements
You need Git for cloning this repo and PIP for installing the scoreboard software.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git python-pip
```

#### Installing the software
This installation process might take some time because it will install all the dependencies listed below.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mikemountain/fantasy-football-scoreboard
cd fantasy-football-scoreboard/
sudo chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
[rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master/bindings/python#building): The open-source library that allows the Raspberry Pi to render on the LED matrix.

[requests](https://requests.kennethreitz.org/en/master/): To call the API and manipulate the received data.

## Testing & Optimization (IMPORTANT)
If you have used a LED matrix on a raspberry pi before and know how to run it properly, then you can skip this part. 

If you just bought your LED matrix and want to run this software right away, reference the [rpi-rgb-led-matrix library](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/). Check out the section that uses the python bindings and run some of their examples on your screen. For sure you will face some issues at first, but don't worry, more than likely there's a solution you can find in their troubleshooting section.
Once you found out how to make it run smoothly, come back here and do what's next.

### Adafruit HAT/bonnet
If you are using any thing from raspberry pi 3+ to the newest versions with an Adafruit HAT or Bonnet, here's what [RiffnShred](https://github.com/riffnshred) did to run his board properly. It seems these are more recommendations than things you 100% absolutely need to do, but are probably beneficial anyway.

* Do the hardware mod found in the [Improving flicker section ](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix#improving-flicker).
* Disable the on-board sound. You can find how to do it from the [Troubleshooting sections](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix#troubleshooting)
* From the same section, run the command that remove the bluetooth firmware, unless you use any bluetooth device with your pi.

Finally, here's the command he used.
```
sudo python main.py --led-gpio-mapping=adafruit-hat-pwm --led-brightness=60 --led-slowdown-gpio=2
```

## Usage
Open the config.json file from the root folder and change these values:

* ```league_id``` - this value can be found in the Sleeper URL: ```https://sleeper.app/leagues/<league_id>/team```
* ```user_id``` - Run the following command, value will be listed in the output. Use the username that you use to login to Sleeper: ```curl "https://api.sleeper.app/v1/user/<username>"```
* ```opening_day``` - there will probably be a better way to get this info but meh, you have to change it once a year. Set it year, month, date format with dashes: 2019-09-05. Make sure it's the Thursday, the NFL Kickoff Game, the date the first game is on!

Now, in a terminal, cd to the fantasy-football-scoreboard folder and run this command. 
```
sudo python main.py 
```
**If you run your screen on an Adafruit HAT or Bonnet, you need to supply this flag.**
```
sudo python main.py --led-gpio-mapping=adafruit-hat
```

### Flags
Use the same flags used in the [rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/) library to configure your screen.
```

--team-id                Set your fantasy team ID
```
